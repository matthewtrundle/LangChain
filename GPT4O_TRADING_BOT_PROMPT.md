# GPT-4o Trading Bot Enhancement Prompt

## Context
I'm working on a Solana yield farming bot that currently has limitations. The user expected to be able to run multiple trading strategies simultaneously with strategy-specific UIs, but the current implementation only supports one strategy at a time.

## Current State
1. Single `TradingBot` instance with one strategy
2. Paper trading exists but UI doesn't use it properly  
3. No strategy-specific UI views
4. Wallet connection required even for paper trading

## Goals
1. Enable multiple strategies to run concurrently
2. Create strategy-specific UI dashboards
3. Seamless paper trading mode
4. Better portfolio analytics across strategies

## Technical Constraints
- Backend: Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js/React, TypeScript
- Must maintain existing API structure for backward compatibility

## Your Role as Copilot
I need you to:
1. Design the multi-strategy architecture
2. Plan the implementation steps
3. Create the API endpoints needed
4. Design the UI components
5. Handle the paper/real trading mode switch

## Specific Questions

### Architecture
1. Should we create a `StrategyManager` service that spawns multiple `TradingBot` instances?
2. How do we handle capital allocation across strategies? Fixed split or dynamic?
3. Should strategies share the same position pool or have isolated positions?

### Implementation  
1. What's the cleanest way to modify the existing `TradingBot` to support multiple instances?
2. How do we track performance per strategy in the database?
3. What new API endpoints do we need?

### UI/UX
1. How should the strategy selector work? Checkboxes for multi-select?
2. What metrics are most important for each strategy type?
3. How do we show aggregate vs per-strategy performance?

### Paper Trading
1. Should paper mode be a global switch or per-strategy?
2. How do we make it obvious when in paper mode?
3. Should paper trades be stored separately in the database?

Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan with:
1. Architecture diagram/description
2. Step-by-step implementation guide
3. Code snippets for key components
4. UI mockup descriptions
5. Migration strategy from current single-strategy system

Remember: The user wants to see different UI views for different strategies and run multiple strategies at once. Paper trading should work seamlessly without requiring wallet connection.
