# 1-Week Implementation Plan with AI Collaboration

## Overview
This plan outlines how Claude CLI and GPT-4o will collaborate to complete the Solana Degen Yield Hunter MVP in 1 week.

## Day 1: Real Blockchain Integration
### Morning
```bash
# Consult DeFi Strategist on data requirements
./gpt5 "As DeFi Strategist: What specific on-chain data points are essential for accurate yield hunting on Solana? Consider: AMM pools, lending rates, perps funding, staking yields."

# Consult Builder on Helius integration
./gpt5 "As Builder: We need to replace mock pool data with real Helius RPC calls. Should we use REST API, WebSocket, or both? Current mock structure: [show interface]"
```

### Implementation
- Replace mock pool scanner with real Helius integration
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Add proper error handling and rate limiting

### Afternoon
```bash
# Security review of RPC integration
./gpt5 "As Auditor/SecOps: Reviewing Helius RPC integration. Using API key from env, implementing rate limits. Any security concerns?"
```

## Day 2: Position Tracking & P&L
### Morning
```bash
# DeFi expertise for P&L calculations
./gpt5 "As DeFi Strategist: Implementing P&L for concentrated liquidity positions. Need formulas for: entry/exit prices, IL calculation, fee accrual, gas costs. Solana-specific considerations?"

# Builder guidance on data structure
./gpt5 "As Builder: Designing position tracking system. Need to store: entry price, current price, fees earned, IL, gas spent. PostgreSQL schema recommendations?"
```

### Implementation
- Complete PositionManager service
- Implement P&L calculator with fee tracking
- Add impermanent loss calculations
- Create position snapshot system

## Day 3: Production Observability
### Morning
```bash
# SRE consultation on monitoring
./gpt5 "As SRE/Observer: Setting up production monitoring for DeFi app. Need to track: RPC latency, position updates/sec, P&L accuracy, WebSocket uptime. Recommend metrics and alert thresholds."

# Builder on logging implementation
./gpt5 "As Builder: Implementing structured logging with pino. How to structure logs for: agent decisions, position updates, errors? Need trace ID propagation across services."
```

### Implementation
- Add structured logging throughout codebase
- Implement trace ID generation and propagation
- Create health check endpoints
- Set up report generation system

## Day 4: Testing & Security Hardening
### Morning
```bash
# Auditor comprehensive review
./gpt5 "As Auditor/SecOps: Full security review needed. Components: wallet interactions, RPC calls, position tracking, API endpoints. What's your security checklist?"

# Builder on test strategy
./gpt5 "As Builder: Need 95% test coverage on critical paths. What testing approach for: WebSocket mocks, P&L calculations, agent decisions?"
```

### Implementation
- Write comprehensive test suite
- Add integration tests with testnet
- Security hardening based on audit
- Fix any vulnerabilities found

## Day 5: Frontend Integration & Polish
### Morning
```bash
# Executive on feature priorities
./gpt5 "As Executive AI: 2 days left. Current state: [list completed]. Frontend needs: real-time updates, position dashboard, alerts. What features are must-have vs nice-to-have?"

# Builder on real-time architecture
./gpt5 "As Builder: Connecting Next.js frontend to WebSocket updates. Best approach for: state management, optimistic updates, connection resilience?"
```

### Implementation
- Complete frontend real-time integration
- Polish UI/UX for demo
- Add position dashboard with P&L
- Implement alert system

## Day 6: Integration & Demo Prep
### Morning
```bash
# Executive final review
./gpt5 "As Executive AI: Final day. Demo tomorrow. Checklist: [features completed]. What's the compelling demo narrative? What could go wrong?"

# SRE on demo reliability
./gpt5 "As SRE/Observer: Preparing for live demo. How to ensure: stable WebSocket, consistent data, no crashes? Fallback strategies?"
```

### Implementation
- End-to-end testing
- Prepare demo script
- Create fallback data if needed
- Final bug fixes

## Day 7: Demo & Documentation
### Morning
```bash
# Executive on presentation
./gpt5 "As Executive AI: Demo day. Key points to highlight for: technical interview, portfolio, actual DeFi use. 5-minute pitch structure?"
```

### Activities
- Run live demo
- Document key achievements
- Create LinkedIn post
- Plan next phase improvements

## Daily Rituals

### Morning Standup (with Executive AI)
```bash
./gpt5 "As Executive AI: Daily update - Yesterday: [completed], Today: [planned], Blockers: [issues]. Should we adjust priorities?"
```

### Evening Review (with appropriate role)
```bash
./gpt5 "As [relevant role]: Completed [feature]. Implementation: [approach]. Concerns: [any issues]. Feedback on approach?"
```

### When Blocked
```bash
./gpt5 "As [relevant role]: Blocked on [issue]. Tried: [attempts]. Context: [details]. Alternative approaches?"
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Real blockchain data (no mocks)
- ✅ Accurate P&L tracking with fees
- ✅ Production-grade observability
- ✅ 95% test coverage on critical paths
- ✅ Live demo without crashes
- ✅ Actually useful for DeFi trading

## Risk Mitigation
- Helius API issues → Fallback to cached data
- WebSocket instability → Reconnection logic
- Demo failures → Pre-recorded backup
- Time pressure → Focus on core features

This collaborative approach ensures we leverage both Claude's implementation capabilities and GPT-4o's specialized expertise to deliver a production-quality MVP in one week.
