# Real Collaboration Example: Implementing Position Monitoring

This example shows how Claude CLI collaborates with GPT-4o to implement the position monitoring system.

## Scenario
Claude needs to implement real-time position monitoring with P&L tracking for the Solana Degen Yield Hunter.

## Collaboration Flow

### 1. Initial Planning (Executive AI)
```bash
# Claude consults for strategic direction
gpt5 "As Executive AI: Starting position monitoring implementation. We have: 1) Basic pool scanner working, 2) Mock position data, 3) 1 week timeline. Should we prioritize: A) Real-time P&L accuracy, B) Multi-protocol support, or C) Historical tracking? Goal is demo-worthy and useful."

# GPT-4o responds with strategic priorities
# Claude creates implementation plan based on guidance
```

### 2. Technical Architecture (Builder)
```bash
# Claude needs architecture guidance
gpt5 "As Builder: Designing position monitor for Solana. Requirements: Track entries/exits, calculate P&L with fees, monitor 100+ positions, support Orca/Raydium/Meteora. Should we: 1) Poll RPC every 30s, 2) WebSocket subscriptions, 3) Hybrid? Consider Helius rate limits."

# GPT-4o provides technical recommendation
# Claude implements chosen architecture
```

### 3. DeFi Logic (DeFi Strategist)
```bash
# Claude needs DeFi expertise
gpt5 "As DeFi Strategist: Implementing P&L calculations for concentrated liquidity positions. Need to account for: IL, trading fees earned, price range, rebalancing costs. What's the correct formula for Uniswap V3 style positions on Solana?"

# GPT-4o provides DeFi formulas and considerations
# Claude implements calculation logic
```

### 4. Security Review (Auditor/SecOps)
```bash
# Claude requests security review
gpt5 "As Auditor/SecOps: Position monitor accesses wallet to read balances and positions. Current approach: Read-only Keypair from env var, no signing capabilities, caches positions for 30s. Security concerns for this design?"

# GPT-4o identifies security considerations
# Claude implements suggested safeguards
```

### 5. Implementation Progress
```python
# Claude implements based on collective guidance:

# position_monitor.py
class PositionMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Based on Builder guidance: WebSocket + polling hybrid
        self.ws_client = HeliusWebSocket()
        self.rpc_client = HeliusRPC()
        
    async def track_position(self, position: Position):
        # Based on DeFi Strategist: Include all fee tiers
        pnl = self.calculate_pnl_with_il(position)
        
        # Based on Auditor: Read-only operations only
        balance = await self.read_only_balance_check()
        
        # Based on SRE: Structured logging with trace IDs
        logger.info("position_update", trace_id=self.trace_id, position=position.id)
```

### 6. Operational Concerns (SRE/Observer)
```bash
# Claude needs monitoring guidance
gpt5 "As SRE/Observer: Position monitor tracking 150 positions, 5 updates/sec per position. Want to add alerts for: position health < 1.1, IL > 10%, sudden APY drops. What metrics and thresholds for production monitoring?"

# GPT-4o provides monitoring strategy
# Claude implements observability
```

### 7. Testing Strategy (Builder + Auditor)
```bash
# Claude needs test approach
gpt5 "As Builder with Auditor perspective: Need to test position monitor. Have: mock data, testnet access, mainnet historical data. How to ensure P&L calculations are accurate and secure for both testnet and future mainnet?"

# GPT-4o provides comprehensive test strategy
# Claude implements test suite
```

### 8. Progress Review (Executive AI)
```bash
# Claude reports progress
gpt5 "As Executive AI: Position monitor 80% complete. Done: real-time tracking, P&L calc, WebSocket integration. Remaining: alert system, historical charts. Behind schedule by 1 day. Should we: 1) Cut historical charts, 2) Extend timeline, 3) Simplify alerts?"

# GPT-4o provides priority adjustment
# Claude adjusts plan accordingly
```
