## API Endpoints

### Wallet Endpoints
```bash
# Get wallet balance and summary
GET /wallet

# Get transaction history
GET /wallet/transactions?limit=10

# Get performance metrics
GET /wallet/performance

# Reset wallet (dev only)
POST /wallet/reset
```

### Position Endpoints
```bash
# Enter a new position
POST /position/enter
{
  "pool_address": "...",
  "pool_data": {...},
  "amount": 100
}

# Exit a position
POST /position/exit
{
  "position_id": "...",
  "reason": "manual"
}

# Get all positions
GET /positions

# Get specific position
GET /position/{position_id}

# Check positions (triggers monitor)
GET /monitor/check
```

## Testing

### Run the Wallet Demo
```bash
cd backend
python test_wallet.py
```

This will simulate:
- Entering multiple positions
- Position value changes
- Automatic and manual exits
- Final performance summary

### Reset for Testing
In development mode, you can reset the wallet:
1. Click "Reset Wallet" in the Wallet Dashboard
2. Or call `POST /wallet/reset`

## Position Exit Rules

### Stop Loss (-10%)
Automatically exits when position loses 10% of value

### Take Profit (+50%)
Automatically exits when position gains 50%

### APY Degradation
Exits if APY drops more than 50% from entry

### Low Liquidity
Exits if pool TVL drops below $10,000

### Rug Risk
Exits immediately if rug pull indicators detected

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with $100 positions first
2. **Diversify**: Don't put all funds in one pool
3. **Monitor APY**: High APYs often degrade quickly
4. **Check Liquidity**: Ensure pools have sufficient TVL
5. **Review History**: Learn from past trades

## Example Workflow

1. **Scan for Opportunities**
   ```
   Quick Scan 500%+ ‚Üí Find 10 pools
   ```

2. **Analyze Top Pools**
   ```
   Analyze BONK/SOL ‚Üí Degen Score: 7.5/10
   ```

3. **Enter Position**
   ```
   Enter $250 ‚Üí Position created
   ```

4. **Monitor Performance**
   ```
   +15% after 6 hours ‚Üí Still holding
   ```

5. **Exit Strategy**
   ```
   Auto-exit at +50% ‚Üí Profit locked in
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Balance"
- Check wallet balance in dashboard
- Ensure you have funds after fees
- Consider smaller position size

### "Maximum Positions Reached"
- Exit some positions first
- System limits to 5 active positions

### "Position Size Too Large"
- Maximum $1,000 per position
- Split into multiple smaller positions

### Position Not Updating
- Refresh the dashboard
- Check `/monitor/check` endpoint
- Positions update every 30 seconds

## Development

The wallet system uses:
- In-memory storage (resets on restart)
- Simulated price movements
- Mock gas fees (0.01 SOL per transaction)
- Configurable parameters in `config.py`

For production, you would:
- Use a real database
- Integrate with actual wallets
- Fetch real-time prices
- Calculate actual gas fees
